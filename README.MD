# About this project

I have made this project through a program which taught me PHP, SQL and Wordpress. While it is not one of my best-looking projects, it works and functions pretty well. It mainly uses PHP and CSS.

# ,,How can I make it work?"

In order to make this website work, you will need either Local by Flywheel or XAMPP.
For XAMPP, you need to place the entire folder inside the 'htdocs', open it up and run the APACHE and MySQL services in order to make it work. Finally, access the 'localhost:3000'(or whatever port you have) and that's it.
For Local by Flywheel, not much is required except making a new project, adding the folder and then running the site.
